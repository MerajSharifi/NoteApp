# Note App

## Description

This is a full-stack web application built with React, Node.js, MangoDB, and Tailwind.

It was one of the projects in learning React.js for [Hack Your Future](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH) Denmark's curriculum.


The main functionalities of this website are:

-   Creating a new note file
-   Displaying the created notes
-   Removing notes
-   Searching notes

## Technologies Used

-   Express.js
-   MangoDB
-   React
-   Tailwind
-   CSS Modules

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I faced several challenges that helped me learn new skills and technologies. 
Some of the challenges I faced included building a database and connecting to MangoDB on the cloud server.
Through these challenges, I was able to gain a better understanding of Database, React, CSS Modules, and Tailwind. 

Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me and helped me grow as a developer. 

I would like to add an editing function later to this app.
